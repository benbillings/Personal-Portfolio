                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>Hello! My name is Ben Billings. I am 20 years old, live in Columbus, Ohio, and am an 
                aspiring web developer. I currently work at a restaurant in town as a food runner and 
                host; I also work for Search2Close, a title company, as a recording specialist.
                I am studying web development through the Vanderbilt University Coding Bootcamp. 
                You can find <a href="./index.html.mywork">my work</a> below as well as my 
                <a href="./index.html.contact">contact</a> information.</p>

                <h2>My goals</h2>
                <p>When I graduated high school in 2020, I didn't have much of a plan for my future.
                I attended the University of Southern California for one year, where I was studying
                economics. However, I was feeling unfulfilled, and decided to leave school to pursue
                other opportunities. Coding was of interest to me because I am typically a logical 
                thinker, and I love problem solving. I also love the idea of being able to create 
                something, so web development seems like the perfect fit for me!
