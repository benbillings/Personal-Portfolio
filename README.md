# Personal-Portfolio

## Deployed Application Link:

## Purpose

My purpose with the project was not only to create a professional portfolio that will serve as a display for all of my future work, but also to put my newly acquired css skills to the test. At times it was frusturating; I felt like I knew how to solve any problem that may have come up and yet it still took many attempts to do so. While I may not feel that this page is ever completley finished, I am proud of the work I have done thus far.

## Technologies used

- CSS
- HTML

## Features

- Nav bar with links to sections of the website
- Image that also functions as a link
- Flex display styling

## Improvements to be made

- When clicking a link in the nav bar, the section the user is taken to is displayed under the nav bar itself
- The page is responsive to some degree, but does not function properly on small screens such as a phone or tablet (this is my next priority)
